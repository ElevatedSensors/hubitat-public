# Switch LED Dashboard

This application allows easy linking of Hubitat device, variables and HSM states to LEDs of your Inovelli Blue Series Zigbee switches (https://inovelli.com/collections/inovelli-blue-series).

You can link states such as contact sensors open/closed, motion sensors active/inactive, locks locked/unlocked and more to LEDs of various colors on your switch. States can share an LED by using priority levels allowing the same LED to show yellow if a door is unlocked, red if locked and blink if the alarm has been tripped.

Thanks to Mattias Fornander (@mfornander) for the original application concept
